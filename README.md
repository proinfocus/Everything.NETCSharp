# Everything .NET C#
This repo is all about designing a course for everyone to learn everything about .NET and C# which I presume takes about **10 months** to touch every aspect mentioned below. I can share my real business experience on the platforms, tools, service providers and technologies as I have personally used them in several projects and implemented in my business one way or the other. I have about **25+ years** of experience in building software, websites, mobile apps and business solutions for my clients mostly using Microsoft technologies, so is the :heart: for .NET and C#.

## Best Practices and Patterns
I believe whatever practices and patterns fulfil the requirements of the client in a minimal amount of time with good efficiency is the best approach. While doing so, you will definitely include and use a combination of **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself), **SOLID** (Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Sustitution, Interface Segregation and Dependency Inversion) and **KISS** (Keep it simple, Stupid!). The project management methodologies can be anything. Whether it is **AGILE** or **SCRUM**, a good product in time matters.
